## My Project

For my project, I will analyze `data.txt` in `project_data` folder. 

For now, there is no need to download any `R` packages.

## Execute the analysis

To execute the analysis, from the `project_data` folder you can run

```bash
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('hw3.Rmd')"
```

This will create a file called `hw3.html` output in your directory that contains the results.
