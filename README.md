## My Project

For my project, I will analyze __data.txt__ in __project_data__ directory.

For now, there is no need to download any R packages.

## Execute the analysis

To execute the analysis, you can run

__Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('hw3.Rmd')"__

This will create a file called __hw3.html__ output in your directory that contains the results.
