## My Project

For my project, I will analyze the data from ~~data.txt~~.
For now, there is no need to download any R packages.

## Execute the analysis

To execute the analysis, you can run

~~Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('hw3.Rmd')"~~

This will create a file called ~~hw3.html~~ output in your directory that contains the results.
